# Introduction

Please have them create a site with the following features:
* Registration page
* Log in page
* Members only dashboard section required after logging in or registering
* The members only page would contain:
** a list of posts submitted by other users
** ability to submit a post (can be as simple as a message)
** ability to edit the post, if the authenticated user is the owner
Some rules for this:
* Do not use a bundle like FOSUserBundle for handling user registration and authentication.
* Be creative with the styling; please don't submit a plain (non-styled) site.
